# World of Warcraft Sentiment Analysis and Customer Satisfaction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of the World of Warcraft community regarding various aspects of the game, such as updates, expansions, gameplay features, and more. Utilizing data from Twitter, Reddit, and Blizzard's API, we will employ Machine Learning techniques to gauge community sentiment, identify trends, and uncover insights that could inform both players and developers alike.

## Objectives
- To collect and analyze social media data related to World of Warcraft.
- To implement sentiment analysis using Machine Learning models to understand community sentiment.
- To identify key factors that contribute to positive or negative sentiment within the WoW community.
- To visualize sentiment trends over time in relation to game updates and community events.
- to wrap finalized code and models into an interactive environment using front-end development

## Data Sources
- **Twitter**: Tweets mentioning World of Warcraft, using specific hashtags and keywords.
- **Reddit**: Posts and comments from the WoW subreddit and other relevant forums.
- **Blizzard API**: In-game data that might correlate with community sentiment.

## Tools and Technologies
